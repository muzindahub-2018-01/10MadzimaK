				<h2>What is Love</h2>
				</header>
			<p>No love story ever touched my heart than that of my mom and dad. My dad was still my mother’s boyfriend when he spent more than two months eating sadza and kapenta in order to cut down on his monthly budget, just to save up money to buy an engagement ring. According to the few weddings I have been to, couples spend around $7000 on the wedding alone. This is quite a lot of money but it is nothing compared to the real costs of marriage and love. Like it or not, love will cost you more than money. It will cost you a price higher than the wedding or the ring, it will cost you yourself. </p>
			<p>I hear married people saying you should not be with someone if you are not happy. It is an attitude that many people have and I do not think we can condone it. This shows the self-centered society we have nowadays where everyone believes their main goal in life is their own personal happiness. This is a shallow way of thinking and living. If you are getting married with your own happiness as your main goal, you will be disappointed in a severe way. Love is not about your happiness, it is not even about you. Love is something we choose to give time and time again. It is about sacrifice, serving, giving, forgiving and then doing it all over again.</p>
			<p>No wonder we choose divorce over commitment. Often, we’re choosing “personal happiness” over real commitment and real love. They say marriage teaches you more about selflessness than you ever wanted to know. I have definitely found that phrase to be true in my mother’s relationship with my father. We have to know that at the heart of it, real love is all about sacrifice and about the giving of yourself, in ways big and small.</p>
			<p>It’s about offering forgiveness when you’ve been hurt. It’s about giving your time though it’s not always convenient. It’s about sharing your heart when you’d rather hold back. It’s about cleaning the kitchen after a long weekend, even if it’s your least favorite job. It’s about choosing to respond with love when you’d rather respond in anger. It’s about offering a listening ear, when you’d rather tune out or go to bed. It’s about putting someone else’s needs and desires before your own. It’s about giving up that last bite of cake, just so your spouse can enjoy it. It’s about laying down your rights, to make way for the rights of another. The list could go on and on, but it always ends with the same formula: You before me, and we before I.</p>
			<p>We live in a world that despises the sacrificial side of marriage and tries to wish it away. They teach to strive for power, control and the upper hand in a relationship. They tell us to do what feels right, and not to tolerate anything less. They fool us to thinking that love is about doing what makes us happy. And the second we feel less than happy, they encourage us to bail, to abandon ship and to stop investing. But they’ve got it all wrong. Because the more we give, the better we become. Real love is not self-seeking, and it will always cost you. It will cost your heart, your time and your money. It will cost your comfort, your rights and your pride. It will cost you to “lay down your life” for the life of another. And only those who learn to die to themselves are the ones who get to experience the resurrection power that comes with it: resurrection into real love, into real life, and into meaningful relationships.</p>
